So, what is a database?
A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.

Cloud storage uses data centers with massive computer servers that physically store the data and make it available online
to users via the web.
Users can remotely upload their content, store them and retrieve the data as and when required.

Can you tell me what can we do to update the ball movement?
Exactly! Now, we could store the ball's position in a common remote database, and our application reads the ball's position from the database and updates it when it changes.

Let's make a remote database for our simple application on the cloud internet.
This remote database will store the state (positions) of the ball and will allow us to read or write to it at any time.
We will be using Google Firebase's Real Time Database for this purpose, which allows syncing the Realtime data across all
the devices without refreshing the screen.

Steps to follow :-
1) We need to create a database.
2) Create the database reference on the client side.
3) Client 1 changes the data in the database.
4) Client 2 requests for the data.
5) Client 2 receives the modified data from the database.
